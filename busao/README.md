This project is a simple bus management system developed in C++ for managing a small bus company. The program supports operations such as:
  Registering new buses with license plates and maximum capacity.
  Managing passenger boarding and disembarking.
  Transferring passengers between buses.
  Displaying the current state of all registered buses.


The system processes commands via standard input, following a specific set of operations (C, S, D, T, I, F), each providing appropriate feedback for success or failure. 
It's structured using C++ classes with separation of concerns between the Empresa (company) and Onibus (bus) modules.
